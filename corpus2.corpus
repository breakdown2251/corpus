Reminds me of when we were kidnapping aboriginal children from their
parents against their will and putting them in Government and church run
Residential Schools where they were then neglected, abused and
ultimately left in unmarked mass graves to be forgotten.

Just remember the Nazis made it legal to do terrible things. And then
they used the laws they wrote as cover when they did those terrible
things. Their cries that they were just enforcing the law didn’t hold up
in court but that mattered little to the people that they had already
killed.

The GOP is taking many of the same steps that the Nazis did to start
genocide and enact a coup. And they are using our legal system against
us because most people believe a law is only passed if the majority of
people support it. And then they feel as if they have no position
questioning a law if it seems unjust.

How many times have we heard, “if people want abortion to be legal then
they’ll legalize it in their states”, only to watch the GOP do
everything they can to make sure minority opinions dictate the laws that
are made? Same goes with countless other topics. They pass laws
pretending it is popular legislation when it is anything but and then it
takes forever to remove the laws and often they don’t get struck down at
all.

Again, the GOP is using our legal system against us. They are going to
make it legal to commit genocide against minority groups and they will
attempt to convince voters it is okay because it is legal. Don’t let
them win that war of public opinion, have those tough talks with your
conservative relatives and friends.

So, in Florida, women are now forced to have children, who may later be
taken from them if the State doesn't like that their parents support
them. Yeah, those quotation marks around "fascist" can be deleted.

This is insane. We need to stand up and shut down the rising tide of
fascism and oppressive governing. The administration is not adhering to
their pledge to represent the people. They're representing rabid
minority views.

How are any of these bills legal?

Stop a business from hanging a sign that says their bathrooms are for
anyone? How pathetic and weak of a person are you to not only support
this legislation but afraid of a sign.

Ban pride parades? That’s right to speech.

Prohibit kids from attending a show even with parental consent? That’s
stripping away parents rights (thought they were trying to give more?).
If you prohibit this then what about attending R movies, having a sip of
beer, or doing anything parents are allowed to enable their children.

Kidnapping kids because of their gender and care is just reprehensible
and truly barbaric.

Step 1: Take over the Supreme Court with your own justices.

Step 2: Write laws that challenge the Constitution.

Step 3: Appeal the rulings against those laws to the Supreme Court.

Step 4: Supreme Court holds the new law is valid.

That's how you make it legal. The Republifascists have seized the
government, and nobody is doing anything about it.

I can’t believe I’m saying this, but parents in states like these with
LGBTQ+ kids should seriously consider fleeing the state. It will get
worse, and possibly never better. Even visiting with an LGBTQ+ kid to
Disney or Universal is a significant risk.

The state of Florida is ready to immolate itself for DeSantis’
presidential ambitions.

Even in republican utopia, what will this achieve? Like you can move
these kids to a group home but they'll still be trans. Move them to an
evangelical home hoping they'll off themselves and save the state the
trouble?

There are a few goals here.

First of all, they are trying to show their base how anti-woke they are
to keep themselves in power while boosting DeSantis' failing
presidential campaign. Trans kids are merely pawns and the Republicans
don't care if they live or die.

Secondly, they are trying to erase trans people from existence. Banning
gender affirming care was the first step. Now, it's seizing kids from
parents who dare to accept their kids for who they are. After that, it
will be banning anyone from presenting themselves as a gender other than
their birth gender. Dress in drag or try to present as the gender you
feel like you are (versus the gender that your external bits say you
are), and you'll be sent to prison for Gender Crimes.

Thirdly, this is another step towards the theocracy that they want to
establish. Their bible says that trans people are against God. (Or
that's what they assume it would say if they actually read it.)
Therefore, trans people don't have a place in the society they want to
build. This group will be expanded to include all LGBTQ folks, Jews,
immigrants, black people, etc. Trans people are just the foot in the door.

Finally, cruelty. The cruelty is always the point. They seem to enjoy
being cruel to people in a way that's very worrying.

They didn’t lose sleep over children being pulled from their mothers at
the border, with no records kept to ever reunite, all for the crime of
seeking a better life. Children left to sleep on concrete floors,
without hygiene products, with thin foil blankets for warmth in metal
cages like animals. This was an idealized treatment in their eyes that
they would have allowed to continue indefinitely. They dehumanized the
immigrant, just as they dehumanize the “trans” child.

No amount of deranged inhumane treatment will bother Republicans so long
as it is demographic they have deemed the “other”.

This is exhausting. I’m so tired of awful things happening in this
country with no way to stop them. We can vote, but only every 2 years,
and even then some people vote for these monsters. Lawsuits and protests
clearly don’t affect these people either, so what’s left?

It hurts my soul seeing this happen when I'm on the other side of the
country. Nothing I do here can do much to help those down there. The
federal government isn't stepping in. States can't put sanctions on
other states, and even if they could I doubt they would. No Florida
politician will care about a far off protest. The best I can do is
refuse to vacation there.

It's happening. There was a video of authorities during a protest where
they separated the children of the protestors. Terrifying.

You send your kid to school, they don't come back

you call the school, they tell you the police took them

you call the police, they give you the runaround

you go to the station, they don't know where your kid is

you hire a lawyer, and by the time court case gets started it's been
months since you've seen your kid

People in Florida should be dragging the politicians who passed this
stuff into the streets of minecraft.

This is what Ceaușescu and his wife did in Romania prior to their
execution when The People finally rebelled. Ceaușescu forcibly removed
children from homes and the State raised them in orphanages. Some were
located in sewers beneath Bucharest. Notice how closely he follows cruel
20th Century European authoritarianism. History DOES repeat itself.

There will be special trans youth re-education centers in FL before too
long. Please ignore the high walls, razor wire, and armed guard towers.
They are there to protect these kids from themselves.

Welcome to trans news, highly underreported and usually undersold. Did
you know that Missouri banned trans health care for anyone not just
children? Did you know that Montana's only trans legislator was straight
up silenced apparently for the rest of the session? Or that the US House
passed an anti trans sports bill? Or that all this anti trans hate can
be directly linked back to a few organizations all collaborating and
working to fuel the very artificially manufactured hate and 2700 pages
of their emails was leaked proving as such?

And I mean even giant newspapers with supposed integrity like the NYT
have been publishing anti trans hit pieces as opinion articles, so who's
going to report on it? Like there's a reason the Onion published a
headline "It Is Journalism’s Sacred Duty To Endanger The Lives Of As
Many Trans People As Possible."

Trans families have known it was never about parental rights, and trans
people have been shouting at the top of our lungs trying to warn
everyone about exactly this kind of thing. Their goal IS genocide of
queer people, starting with trans folks

Fascism has a long history of creeping slowly forward for years or
decades and then the trap snaps closed in an instant. If a state
government starts collecting trans kids and the rest of the country
allows it to happen the trap will have been sprung and we will have a
very hard time moving back towards sanity.

*THIS IS LITERALLY FUCKING GENOCIDE.*

I'm not being hyperbolic. Removing children from their families because
of aspects of their identity — for the purpose of eliminating that
aspect of their identity — is genocide.

If you support this, you're a fucking fascist and the enemy of the people.

Seems more of an agenda then what people want.

It is fucking disgusting that this is being done and that the state
court system is not saying "unconstitutional"

So much for libeety, freedom and the pursuit of happiness... Hypocrites.

It seems like someone is sitting in a backroom thinking of ways to piss
off the LGBTQ+ community.

I want to walk around and ask people who agrees with his measure?

Imagine passing a law that allows the government can remove kids from
parents because they were exposed to religious believes before 18 years
of age.

For legal reasons I want to make it clear that I absolutely do NOT
encourage Floridians to start burning down state buildings and rioting
in the street and enacting violence against state representatives who
commit these hideous crimes against human decency. I do NOT encourage
people to march on Ron DeSantis' home and tear it down. Definitely don't
do that! Do not consider how voting and organizing alone may no longer
be enough. Don't make them fear you!

Florida and Texas are incubators for fascism. What happens in those two
states, if it’s not struck down by the federal courts, will spread like
wildfire across conservative states. And then, once they’ve secured
their own states and ensured that only /they/ have a meaningful chance
of winning elections there, they will begin to focus on the weakening of
liberal democracy in blue states. They’ll fund far-right candidates and
sow discontent among the populations of those states, ensuring
that—federally—they have the numbers to control Congress and the
presidency. They’ve already got the SCOTUS.

This is the fascist way, and anyone who thinks this is just another day
in America, or that the federal courts—to which Donald Trump appointed
more than 30% of the currently seated judges—will save us all, isn’t
living in reality.

Fascism is here, folks. That’s no longer in question. The only question
is: what are we going to do about it?

This is straight from the bill that passed

Be It Enacted by the Legislature of the State of Florida: Section 1.
Subsection (1) of section 61.517, Florida Statutes, is amended to read:
61.517 Temporary emergency jurisdiction.—

(1) A court of this state has temporary emergency jurisdiction if the
child is present in this state and:

(a) The child has been abandoned; or

(b) It is necessary in an emergency to protect the child because the
child, or a sibling or parent of the child, is subjected to or
threatened with mistreatment or abuse; or

(c) It is necessary in an emergency to protect the child because the
child has been subjected to or is threatened with being subjected to
sex-reassignment prescriptions or procedures, as defined in s. 456.001.
Section 2. Subsection (1) of section 61.534, Florida Statutes, is
amended to read: 61.534 Warrant to take physical custody of child.

(1) Upon the filing of a petition seeking enforcement of a child custody
determination, the petitioner may file a verified application for the
issuance of a warrant to take physical custody of the child if the child
is likely to imminently suffer serious physical harm or removal from
this state. Serious physical harm includes, but is not limited to, being
subjected to sex-reassignment prescriptions or procedures as defined in
s. 456.001. Section 3

So since dressing in drag or being trans in public can now be considered
child sexual abuse, it looks like they can take all the kids in the
house is and trans person lives there.

Also they can be taken if the child is "likely be removed from the state"

I really hope I'm misunderstanding this, I'm no lawyer and it seems like
these are intentionally confusing.

But this is fucking terrifying. The party that talks so much about how
the LIBRULS are going to take your rights and guns away, sure are
removing a shit ton of rights, than their followers are cheering them on.

These are the same people who fought wearing masks during a fucking
world wide pandemic because it was a slippery slope to losing rights to
the government.

Now women are forced to have children even if it might kill them, the
baby, or both. They are banning books. They cannot teach history as it
actually happened. The "can't say gay" laws. People can be registered as
sex offenders for wearing the clothing they want to wear in public.
There are so many more rights today are being infringed, but I'm getting
more and more furious the more that I type.

But hey, at least they can still have their guns.

federal judge should be able to put a stop to this.

Unless the federal judge was appointed by Trump. In that case, they'll
probably rule that gender affirming care is hereby banned nationwide.

Mini Hitler, except it’s not aimed at Jews…yet. It’s essentially “sexual

The Nazis started with trans in 1933.
<https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-forgotten-history-of-the-worlds-first-trans-clinic/>

The night of long knives, when the Nazis killed all the socialists, was
in 1934.

The lying Republicans are mirroring the Nazis' rise to power.

The desire for power must always have an out-group to attack.
<https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/martin-niemoeller-first-they-came-for-the-socialists>

    First they came for the socialists, and I did not speak out—because
    I was not a socialist.

    Then they came for the trade unionists, and I did not speak
    out—because I was not a trade unionist.

    Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out—because I was
    not a Jew.

    Then they came for me—and there was no one left to speak for me.

—Martin Niemöller

So, who is next? More LGBTQ+ or progressive caucus members?

And then who is after that?

When are you, reader, next?

Not aimed at jews yet. The right doesn't like us. I've been called the
"good jew" by Republicans since I was a kid. They tolerate rich jews
because business success is proof of virtue, but that veneer won't last
forever, I don't think.

This on top of:

1 - Make Drag in Public illegal and considered a Sex crime against
children.

2 - Make sex crimes against children punishable by death.

3 - Begin allowing death penalty sentencing at an 8-4 vote instead of an
unanimous vote.

Imagine if Democrats passed a bill in California saying that kids under
18 get taken away if their parents circumcised them or let them pierce
their ears. And those things don't have the backing and rigorous studies
of the fields of medicine, science, and psychology like trans care does.

Except this is exactly what the GOP wants. They will lie, cheat, steal,
force through supreme court justices, and gerrymander in order to
maintain their christofacist laws. And no one on the left will do shit
about it. Look at how much they did when Roe v. Wade was overturned—lots
of talk, no action.

To all the fence-sitters who just don't care about trans rights - the
same constitutional protections being tested against trans people will
be applied to any other group that the Republicans don't like, be it
gays, any ethnic group, people from any nationality, people of any
religion, etc.

My friends, now is the time to flee if you can. It pains me to say, and
it might be an unpopular or unpatriotic decision, but I am looking to
relocate my family abroad as soon as I can. As if it wasn’t bad enough
we have to fear sending our children to school, we also have to fear
them being able to grow up and be themselves. I’m hoping, praying that
this will all erupt like a nuclear bomb and the conservatives will be
beaten by a landslide in 2024, but I’m not hopeful. In the event they
take office in 2024, interracial marriage, gay marriage, and the right
to freedom of religion will be out the door soon after. If you’re not a
white, cis, hetero Christian, get ready to flee in 2024.

So the “don’t say gay” law and the Disney laws were to “protect a
parents right to govern the morals and values dictated to children” but
now they are passing a bill that completely contradicts a parents right
to parent.

I’m not a lawyer so I’m sure there’s more complicated legal jargon at
play- but don’t the bills create a legal contradiction????

For anyone who thinks they will stop with trans children, think again.
The fascist always requires an enemy to circle the wagons against. Once
they are done with transgenders and abortion they will move on to LGBT
and feminists as a whole. It will become illegal to so much as speak
about either subject/group, and Desantis doesn’t care if he has to piss
on the constitution to achieve this. Once those are beaten down they
will come for ALL left wing groups/ideologies. He must be stopped at all
costs.

They’re fully aware none of these bills they’ve passed the last year are
going to cause any minors to detransition or help a single individual or

So I think what is going on here is a massive change or evolution in
humanity. Although it does not look like it at all right now, eventually
the progressive nature will win.

What we are seeing and living through now is akin to a dying deer. In
the moments right before a deer dies it can, with its last ounce of
energy jump up and bound off, almost like they are 100% fine. I feel the
conservative movement is almost dead and this is their last dying
breath, they are using their last bit of energy to try and fuck shit up
and hold back the progress that is inevitably going to happen.

The children are our future and that is why they want to dumb them down
and keep them away from anything that may help them develop better
critical thinking skills.

Seems that this is all leading to purging the LGBTQ+ population from the
state. I don't know what percentage it makes up, but if 5%, that could
be just enough to keep the state red for the next couple of elections.
After watching Georgia flip, the GOP is absolutely terrified of losing
more states. If either FL or TX flipped, there would never be another
GOP president. So now you see TX and FL playing as dirty as they can,
regardless of how damning it is.

So if I were the mastermind of the GOP, I'd certainly be finding every
possible way to alienate any group that was predominately Democrat. We
are witnessing the end of the GOP. Their death rattle. When facing
complete annihilation, you do anything to survive.

Under what power granted to the federal government would you propose
they do stop it. There is no inter-state commerce clause that can be
applied here, so I would assume the 10th takes precedence.

A convention of states could convene and amend the constitution to add
federal veto power, but there is no federal veto of state law currently
that I know of.

People like my parents are the problem in Florida. They are lifelong
Republicans and watch FL local news which is full of the same BS as Fox
News. They think DeSantis is a strong leader because the news tells them
he is everyday. They also would never vote for a Democrat because they
never have. They still have this weird notion that all young ppl are
Dems and will eventually grow up to be Republicans. They don’t
understand that we no longer live in a politically moderate world and
that the difference between candidates is not just tax policy. FL news
is spinning these fascist laws as wins. And because these laws don’t
impact my geriatric parents they can choose to ignore them. The citizens
of Florida are the proverbial toad in a pot whose water is about to boil.

So then where does it end? First theyll come for Trans, non binary, and
just general gender queer kids, then theyll come for the gay/ lesbian/
bisexual teens, then theyll take the kids that do not conform to their
religious idealogy until all that's left is those that uphold strict,
christo-facist, hypocritical doctrine.

They did this once before, seperating families, only last time you
wouldn't understand it because it was all in German.

Edit: and this doesn't just end here. How long till we have the mental
institutions, filled to the brim w/ gay ppl that had no fucking issues,
awaiting electro-shock therapy "to turn them straight"? When god
fearing, country loving gays in the military, have to be afraid of
sending their loved ones letters and risk being dishonorably discharged
because of their sexuality?

We're trending down a very dangerous, very dark path.

Did you ever notice that Republicans always talk about how government
intrusion is such a terrible thing and then the want to control every
aspect of everybody's lives?

Buy guns and protect your family from child abductors, badged or

Parental rights only count if the parents are forcing fundamentalist
Christianity on their children. For parents who don’t want to do that
there are no parental rights.

I called this shit years ago. But nobody wants to associate republicans
as fascist. The Reagan era diverse family loving, free market, you do
you I do me, religious pluralism, middle class small business, small
government is gone. It died with John McCain.

All we have is this Neo Republican Party or “maga” bull shit which is
really just fascism holding a bible where the only difference between it
and the Taliban is the book.

At the same time claiming "parents' rights" in education. I get that the
cruelty is the point here and fascists love being able to drown us in
hypocrisy but at some point Floridians need to meet fascism with force.

I really don't wanna say something that is gonna get me banned and I
really don't want to be super lazy in going to the "Nazi reference"
well. But everything that's happening in Florida right now reminds me of
the Nazi rally held in Madison square garden. How the fuck is any of
this acceptable and at what point are we going to accept that this
country is broken and there needs to be serious intervention?

I want to be clear, I think resorting to a war/conflict either literally
or figuratively represents an absolute failure on society's part to do
the essential maintenance that keeps democracy functioning. I think a
lot of these battles are fought because of the failures to address
issues with other, better, long term tools while we still can.

That being said, and make of this what you will, what I think is about
to happen to the trans community in the next decade or so is going to be
an extremely shameful chapter in our nation's history. I think it could
be as proportionately lethal as the AIDS epidemic was for the gay
community. I think it could be as barbaric as lobotomy when it was a
common enough practice. And it makes me sick to my stomach. I would
really like to prevent that because I think the cost of coming back will
be extremely high. But unfortunately, I think the cost of preventing
that future is also higher than people are willing to pay at this point.

Again, this is not advocacy for violence. But perhaps disruption, which
I think is patriotic no matter what anyone else tells you. Plenty of
people will put down the Black Lives Matter "riots" and will compare it
to January 6th in poor faith. I would sooner compare that summer to the
Boston Tea Party. It just depends on your point of view I guess, but
disruptive protest has been proven to work in our nation's history and
has been considered patriotic. When the social contract is broken
<https://youtu.be/llci8MVh8J4>, people reach their limits. In 1776 it
was taxation without representation. Today, its being murdered by the
state and then being expected to participate and pay into in that
system. If you hated what happened the summer of 2020, I am 100% with
you. You know what I'd like to do with that feeling? Reform the police.

I think the trans community and their allies are about to find their
limits and feel as though the social contract has been broken. MLK said
a riot is the language of the unheard. What is coming tomorrow will be
the inevitable consequence of inaction today.

Does anyone else remember that when Obama's administration even breathed
a heavy sigh, Republicans would go on Fox and yell that that was the
kind of tyranny that the founding fathers envisioned when they made sure
we would have the tools to overthrow the government? Those same people
are the architects of the fascist hellscape in Florida. They are the
tyrants the founding fathers were terrified of.

Might have to pull a Kyle Shittenhouse and go defend my people who are
under attack. No American should stand for this and it is incredibly
disappointing that after four years of Trump corruption and lies and an
insurrection and indictment, overturning Roe, and a million other things
that the American people have not yet rebuked republicans on a large
scale. As in, if Christian parents were told that they are liable for
abuse and their kids might be taken away, the nation would be in uproar.
The fact that Roe was overturned and there was no widespread sustained
reaction, and same with every anti abortion bill in all the states, and
all of the anti transgender bills, etc. If armed atheists started
showing up at churches on Sunday just like the republicans protesting
drag shows, maybe things would be different. So when they try to make
these laws, get fucking angry. Be angry that one group is conspiring to
take over the country with or without democracy. Be angry that treading
on my rights means treading on everyone’s rights. That if you allow the
state to take Transgender children away from their parents you are
violating a sacred right that is far more important than any state
rights. You are permitting the abuse of power for special interests
above our rights as Americans, and as human beings.

So many people don’t believe that their rights could ever be infringed
upon. They believe with their privilege that they are safe and perhaps
they are for a time but that does not negate the urgency and impact and
risk to everyone.

Yet another bill that will be struck down in courts, again? Of course.

There should be some financial recoup against elected officials that
pass laws that get struck down. This is a large waste of tax payers
money, both in Florida and in our Federal government. If we could dock
salaries of elected officials that voted for it, most of these would
disappear.

So when the fuck is the Federal government going to step in and put a
stop to the fascist right. I thought that the main reason we paid taxes
was for protection from aggressors, both foreign and domestic. If they
can not protect us... well, let's take some lessons from the French.

Or, why the fuck do we pay almost 1trillion dollars a year to the military?

Seems like it might be a savings account for our new fascist leaders.

I am so fucking tired of this shit. I am 41. My moms are an interracial
lesbian couple who have been together since i was fucking 6. My stepmom
is a better parent than my bio dad ever was. I live in a state that just
essentially outlawed being transgendered. Not by voters, not by
legislature. How the fuck can an AG have this power!?

Anyway. This is not helping kids. This is hurting not only the trans
folks, or lgbtq+. Everyone is being hurt by this.

I lost friends back in the day because their parents thought i would
make the friend gay cuz my moms are. We need to stop being polite and
call out this ignorant shit for what it is, and not hold back on our
language. This is ignorance. This is stupidity. This is hatred. This is
bullshit.

I do not and will never have children. I am not trans.

I will preface this by saying I am not calling for violence. However,
how is this not a signal for trans and trans allies to see this as a
call to war?

Republicans are using terroristic ideologies disguised as government
policy, to wage warfare on its own citizens.

My point is, I feel this way and arguably don't really have a dog in the
fight. If I were a trans parent or parent of a trans person, this would
cause me to consider physical action.

Fucking incredible.

"The bill is written so that even a child of Floridian parents living

Just in case this wasn't wild enough. Such small government that they
want to fuck with you even if you leave.

Bonus points for this law being actionable if a child is 'at risk'
a.k.a. if someone comes to school with colored hair or a male presenting
kid wears a skirt, the parents could get fucked with.

They are Nazis, cut and dry Nazis, and supporting them in any way is

America claims to be about, FREEDOM for /*ALL*/ people (which includes

Fascism requires there being an other. An other who is simultaneously
weak and inhuman, but also poses an existential threat. It takes about
two neurons in about half a millisecond to realize someone cannot be a
weak inhuman and also strong enough to be an existential threat, but
apparently those requirements are well beyond the Maga base.

Sooooo we can exercise our 2A amendment for the government taking our kids?

The slippery slope: fundamental Christians who abuse their kids by
withholding critical medicines etc. can be removed from their families?

Genuine question here. Why do people care *so much* about how another
person identifies or who they love?

How does two dudes dating affect you at all?

How does someone feeling more like a gender than the one they forced
into, and wanting to transition so that they look it too, change your
day to day life in way, shape, or form?

Why do you hate acceptance so much?

I genuinely do not understand.

The only way this stops is the likes of Disney and other companies

similar deals to what Disney had. I mentioned before, if this happens de

This whole transgender fear is so blatantly wrong! Some people are born
disabled with an arm missing or no eyesight. Nobody has an issue with
that. We just accept that people are different. Somehow some extremist
group managed to make it a wrong when somebody is born with a unusual or
unclear gender. Absolutely fucking wrong from so many standpoints. Its
the worst type of bigotry.

My blood is just boiling. As the proud mom to an NB kid, I'm so thankful
we don't live in a red state. We def have areas that threaten the state
as a whole, but we haven't lost our purple status... yet. They're
already trying to pass stuff in our (PA) legislature, too, and it pisses
me off to no end.

I love how they want us to leave their parental rights alone, but when
the shoe is on the other foot, oh no, that's not allowed. Goddamn
hypocrites!

Seem to see a lot of republicans making this face as of late, almost as
if they’re aware the legislation they’re passing has the stench of their
rotting party all over it. It’s the “look at the dogshit legislation we
passed to piss off liberals and control minorities” look.

Meanwhile in Colorado, corporal punishment is now illegal in our schools
and free meals (breakfast and lunch) is going into place for all school
children. We're not perfect, but here in Colorado we're building a
future we want to live in. I assume the Republicans in Florida are
building the future they want to live in, too. Do you live in one of
"those" states? Which future would you prefer?

Remember, it's not just trans kids. It's kids at risk of being trans. So
if parents speak out for queer rights, they could lose their kids too.
There's no clear guidelines for determining if a kid is at risk of
becoming trans. So it's whatever they want to make up.

This is so goddamn infuriating.

They hide behind “protect the children” while routinely passing bills
and taking stances that hurt the children. They protect abusing
politicians. They strip rights. They enact policies to make life worse
for children.

And they sit there with a smug fucking face as if they are on some
righteous moral high ground.

I also get a bit miffed when so many people used “Nazi” and “Fascism” so

    The Florida Legislature’s insistence on targeting trans people is
    bizarre, unnecessary, unconstitutional, and extremely dangerous."

Shit is bizarre.. like where the fuck did this trans hate come from all
the sudden. It's like republicans found a new boogey-(person) and are
milking it for all its worth

This is truly getting scary for anyone being trans. I fear my state will
follow behind this kind of bill. It’s becoming increasingly difficult to
even consider being open as trans in public. I’ve already seen footage
of teens being held from their parents in a locked room. How are they
going to separate children from parents? Put them in some institution or
some other home once they kidnap these children? I fear so much for what
is to come. Innocent blood will be shed to avoid this or because of what
those kids wish to be.

This article was so absurd, I didn't believe it. Then I read the actual
fuckin bill.

"For purposes of warrants to take physical custody of a child in certain
child custody enforcement proceedings, serious physical harm to the
child includes, but is not limited to, being subjected to
sex-reassignment prescriptions or procedures""

Serious question: What's stopping other states from passing a law thats
says X religion is bad. And you can legally remove kids from that parent
for trying to indoctrinate them?

Seems like if this is allowed to stand you can really go after any group
for almost any reason.

I was a trans kids. From 8-12 I identified as a boy. I shaved my head
and only wore boys clothing. Im 30 now and ive accepted the biological
body I was born with. Im also a lesbian. But I still support trans rights.

Im so glad I went through what I went through before people even knew
what being trans was. Yes I was bullied but atleast I wouldnt have been
taken away from my mom. US is so backwards now. Glad I grew up in the 90s

Republicans have really made their entire party platform: "Let's fuck up
trans people and their families."

It's truly astounding that's what they've fallen to. They literally have
nothing else going on.

If it weren't so dangerous, it'd be hilarious, particularly because
they're rendering themselves more irrelevant with each day that passes.

For every 1 transphobe there's luckily 50 allies.

The most important is just that those 50 don't stay silent when that 1

If you’re in Florida and are trans or have a trans child, it’s time to
flee. Even if you have nothing but the clothes on your back.

This isn’t going to stop. It’s going to get worse because there is no

Meanwhile they're on the path to banning healthcare for trans adults.
The GOP was never about protecting children. They just want another
minority group to demonize while they're enriching themselves.
